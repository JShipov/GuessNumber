# Number Guessing Game
This project is a simple number guessing game built using JavaScript. The game allows a player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20, and will display messages indicating if the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The player starts with a score of 20, and their score will decrease by 1 for each incorrect guess. If the player's score reaches 0, the game is over. The game also includes a "Play Again" button that will reset the game and generate a new secret number.

## Getting Started
